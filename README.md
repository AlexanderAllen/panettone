# Panettone

Panettone is a CLI tool for extracting PHP types from [Open API](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) schemas. Types are generated by interpreting the [data model](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/) (schema) of Open API documents. Unlike Api Platform's [schema generator](https://packagist.org/packages/api-platform/schema-generator), it does not determine types using [path and operations](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/paths-and-operations/).

## Testing

Tests are located in the `tests` directory. PHPUnit is installed separately in the `tools/phpunit` directory.

To test, first use Composer to install PHPUnit then run the test script.

    composer -d tools/phpunit install
    . tools/phpunit/test

## Coverage

Coverage details are gathered during testing in Github and [pushed to Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/AlexanderAllen/panettone).
